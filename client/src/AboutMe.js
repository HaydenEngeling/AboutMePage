const aboutMe = 'I started my IT career at General Motors in June of 2016 as an IT Operations Analyst. The majority of my time was spent identifying server issues and aiding GM dealerships and factories with their website and mainframe issues. In 2019 I began a 2-year work stint for a small solar energy contractor, Speir Innovations, LLC as their Business System Specialist. Speir Innovations, LLC while still in its infancy (2016) was growing exponentially and needed to get systems and programs in place to help make the day-to-day more streamlined and efficient. I had the opportunity to work directly with the owners to develop an operations workflow that would help Speir Innovations, LLC improve their efficiency and increase their productivity. Once the operations workflow was finalized, I was responsible for the procurement and implementation of the programs and applications. \nFueled by a desire to create strong, functional solutions to industrial and business needs, I decided to pursue full-stack software engineering through both formal structured and informal self-guided educational opportunities. It is there that I found myself at home in the tedious detail of the code, challenged by the almost infinite range of possibilities and gratified by creatively finding successful solutions to complex problems.\n I\'m currently looking for a full-stack software engineering position and would love to hear from you and discuss opportunities to use my unique experiences and skills to continue to grow and add value to your business.';
